# Wernher's Old Bits :: Change Log

* 2016-0515: 0.10 (TiktaalikDreaming) for KSP 1.1.2
	+ Added first stage of the Redstone A-6 NAA-75-110 as four parts.
	+ Fuel tank; should be self explanatory
	+ Engine; again, fairly obvious
	+ Engine Shroud; This connects over the engine.  I kept this independent of the engine as with it, the engine is basically a cylinder, which is boring as.
	+ Fins; There's four of these on a historical Redstone rocket, and stack nodes let you attach four easily enough.  The fins are also surface attachable, for any other fin needs you might have.  They include the visual mesh for the control vanes that are more correctly part of the engine, but on the actual A-6 and A-7s was part of the fin mechanism.  There's no animation for the vanes, but once the engine's running, you can't really see them anyway.  BUT, the engine's thrust is actually split into 8, 4 of which correspond to a control vane and are "gimballed".  The other four are central.  This way, some (half) of the thrust is gimballed and the other half isn't.  And, by gimballing four points radially around the centre, gimballing can actually rotate, something normal gimballed engines can't do.  On the other hand, they stuck carbon vanes into the exhaust to achieve this, so it comes at the cost of less thrust, and fairly silly gimballing.  At some stage, I'll convert the A-4 to use this system of multi-gimbal, multi-thrust as well.
* 2016-0514: 0.9 (TiktaalikDreaming) for KSP 1.1.2
	+ Fixed fuel oxidizer ratios.
	+ Added extra colour schemes for those with firespitter core.
* 2016-0220: 0.8 (TiktaalikDreaming) for KSP 1.1.2
	+ Updated and fixed the A-10 engine, specifically because I noticed it was overwriting A-4 engine details if community resource pack was installed, but RealFuels wasn't.  Engine is also my updated mesh and so on.
	+ Also, logo for EMW changed to proto VonBraun logo interruptus
* 2016-0217: 0.7 (TiktaalikDreaming) for KSP 1.0.5
	+ No changelog provided
